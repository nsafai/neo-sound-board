This ADABOX could not have happened with out the amazing support 
and sponsorship from Analog Devices (https://www.analog.com/)

Analog Devices is famous for their high quality MEMS sensors. Did 
you know that Analog Devices pionered the first mass-manufactured 
MEMS accelerometer? Yep! The ADXL50 came in a tin can and had one 
axis of sensing detection. That product was first announced 25 years
ago and ADI has only improved on their designs.

The Trellis M4 Express features the ADXL343, the latest precision
triple axis accelerometer from the experts at MEMS! The ADXL343 gives
the Trellis the ability to sense motion, tilt and taps. So not only
can you squish buttons to make cool sounds, you can even move the board
to change tempo, or filter, or volume.
